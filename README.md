# hello-world
Just a few small snippets of code and random things I made for fun, don't expect anything groundbreaking here.

All of this is for educational purposes so I can learn how to code and have fun while doing it.
If you want to use anything I put here for any law abiding, non commercial uses feel free!

One thing to note is I enjoy learning about Cyber Security so a lot of this will be related to that intrest.
